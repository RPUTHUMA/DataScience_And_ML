d = |Ax + By + Cz + D| / âˆš(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)


Where:
(x, y, z) are the coordinates of the point. 
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 is the equation of the plane. 
A, B, and C are the coefficients of x, y, and z in the plane's equation. 
D is the constant term in the plane's equation. 



d= W^T s/||W||
W^T = transpose of W
S = point
||W|| = magnitude
